Data Structures:
-Lists
-Sets
-Tuples

The data structures differ based on mutability and order.
Mutability refers to the ability to change an object after its creation.
Mutable objects can be modified, added, or deleted after theyâ€™ve been created,
while immutable objects cannot be modified after their creation.
Order, in this context, relates to whether the position of an element can be used to access the element.
