Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program
by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects.

What Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs
so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

For instance, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age,
and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running.
Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject,
and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.

Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete,
real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees,
students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that
have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.

Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming, which structures a program
like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks,
that flow sequentially in order to complete a task.

The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python,
not only representing the data, as in procedural programming,
but in the overall structure of the program as well.
