# ttest_ind âˆ’ Calculates the T-test for the means of two independent samples of scores.
# This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that two independent samples have identical average (expected) values.
# This test assumes that the populations have identical variances by default.

# We can use this test, if we observe two independent samples from the same or different population.
# Let us consider the following example.
