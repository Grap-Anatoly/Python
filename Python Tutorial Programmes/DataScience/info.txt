The SciPy library of Python is built to work with NumPy arrays and provides many user-friendly
and efficient numerical practices such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.
Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install and are free of charge.
NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to depend on by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.


# Pandas

# Pandas is an open-source Python Library used for high-performance
# data manipulation and data analysis using its powerful data structures.

# Key Features of Pandas

# Fast and efficient DataFrame object with default and customized indexing.
# Tools for loading data into in-memory data objects from different file formats.
# Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
# Reshaping and pivoting of date sets.
# Label-based slicing, indexing and subsetting of large data sets.
# Columns from a data structure can be deleted or inserted.
# Group by data for aggregation and transformations.
# High performance merging and joining of data.
# Time Series functionality.

# Pandas deals with the following three data structures −

# Series
# DataFrame

# Series - 1D labeled homogeneous array, size-immutable.
# Data Frames - General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously typed columns

# Series is a one-dimensional array like structure with homogeneous data.
# For example, the following series is a collection of integers 10, 23, 56, …
# 10 23	56 17 52 61	73 90 26 72

# DataFrame is a two-dimensional array with heterogeneous data

# NumPy is a Python package which stands for 'Numerical Python'.
# It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array.

# Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations −

# Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
# Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.
# Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.
