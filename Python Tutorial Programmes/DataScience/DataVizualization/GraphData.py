# CSGraph stands for Compressed Sparse Graph,
# which focuses on Fast graph algorithms based on sparse matrix representations.

# A graph is just a collection of nodes, which have links between them.
# Graphs can represent nearly anything âˆ’ social network connections,
# each node is a person and is connected to acquaintances; images,
# where each node is a pixel and is connected to neighbouring pixels; points in a high-dimensional distribution,
# where each node is connected to its nearest neighbours and practically anything else you can imagine
